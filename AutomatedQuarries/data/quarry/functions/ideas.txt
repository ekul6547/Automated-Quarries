Mining dampener:
start #damp q_d_current = 1
Dampen: {
    Owner: {UUIDMost, UUIDLeast},
    Joined: [] - {UUIDMost, UUIDLeast, init, current}
}
Owner Places block
- register to owner tag - UUIDMost + UUIDLeast
Player sneaks onto block
- if their q_d_current = 0
    - set q_d_current = #damp q_d_current
    - #damp q_d_current += 1
    - send message to owner @a 
        - set #damp QuarryIgnore to 0
        - each @a while QuarryIgnore = 0
            - test UUIDMost + UUIDLeast (like lockbox)
            - if successful
                - set #damp QuarryIgnore to 1
                - set owner q_d_current = to player sneaking q_d_current
                - send message to owner to confirm q_d_current score

When Owner Confirms
- player with identical q_d_current gets added to dampener ArmorItems[{id:paper}].tag.Dampen.players[] append {UUIDMost, UUIDLeast} (appned blank then players[-1] merge)
- set both players q_d_current to 0

test for player in array:
- {UUIDMost, UUIDLeast, init, current}
- foreach
